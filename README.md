Problem: 
Healthcare access is one of the most harmful inequities that exist in our country today. To help provide effective and high-quality care for many urban neighborhoods, we need a better understanding of the chronic disease and behavioral risk issues within a community. This gives doctors and public health officials an additional tool to better understand a community’s specific risks and strengths, which will then inform and shape their interaction with patients in the community

Goal:
Using the 2017 Community Health Survey, a telephone survey conducted annually across New York state by the DOHMH, Division of Epidemiology, Bureau of Epidemiology Services, I wanted to see if I could visually cluster the data into the five boroughs of the New York state based on a subset of the attributes using the K-Means clustering algorithm. This way, I could understand the visual distribution of responses for certain subsets, and whether that particular subset played a role in helping cluster the data. This tool could help us better understand what attributes or areas shape a specific community’s overall health and see we can use this knowledge to improve healthcare outcomes.
